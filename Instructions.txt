Goal:

Draw contours to all objects and textures in the image.
You must draw one contour for each texture in the image.
Some examples of possible segmentation are available in the folder "examples".

Labeling Software Interface:

To start this software open MATLAB, navigate to the folder "Labeling Tool" and run 'startLabeling.m' 

The labeling software has 3 windows:
	Main window: The large window on the right side will show de image. This is where the contours should be drawn.
	Zoom Window: The top left window has buttons to zoom in/out and an overview of the image. 
		The zoom buttons are on the toolbar of that window. Default zoom is 100%, so the image may not be entire visible depending on your monitor resolution.
	Action Window: The bottom left window contains a popup menu for selecting the next action after a contour is inputed:
		"New contour", "Finish labeling" or "Edit Contour 'X'". This menu is not visible while inserting or editing contours.

To stop this software just close it's  windows. 
You can resume the labeling later running it again.

Guidelines to define contours:

To draw a contour, make a closed polygon in the image, clicking on the vertice locations.
Be as accurate as possible when assigning the vertices. Use as many vertices as needed.
After the polygon has been closed, it can be adjusted by dragging the vertices to the desired locations.
(The cursor will change to a circle when pointing to a vertice).
To add a vertex to a closed conturn hold "a" and click in an edge. 
To remove a vertex of a closed conturn right click on the vertex and select "delete vertex".

OBS: 
 - You can drag vertices outside the image to define regions in the image limits.
 - A new contour will overlap any previous ones.
 - You don't need to do all images at once. you can stop by closing the windows

Quick Instructions:

0) on MATLAB, navigate to the folder "Labeling Tool"
1) run 'startLabeling.m' 
2) define a contour by drawing a polygon (click to create vertices).
3) make ajustments to the polygon (drag and drop the vertices).
4) double-click inside the polygon to record that contour
5) choose the next operation on the menu in the left window:
	A) New contour: Repeat the steps 2 to 5 (previous ones will appear as red lines in the image)
	B) Finish labeling:  Save all contours and go to next image.
	C) Edit Contour 'X': a previously inputed contour (all current contours will appear as red lines in the image).

To stop this software just close it's  windows. 
You can resume it later repeating the steps above.
